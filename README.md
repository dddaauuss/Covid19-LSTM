"COVID-19 Prediction using LSTM" 

This project is to create a deep learning model using LSTM neural network to predict new cases (cases_new) in Malaysia using the past 30 days of number of cases. The dataset is sourced from ['https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public/main/epidemic/cases_malaysia.csv'](https://github.com/MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public)https://github.com/MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public
